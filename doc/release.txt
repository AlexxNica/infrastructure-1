                           Release Process
                           ***************

To release a new version of FireHOL, commit a change with up to date
ChangeLog and NEWS (they will be checked before the tag is built).

Tag the commit with a signature:
  git tag -s v2.x.y

Push the tag (origin is the default name of the remote repository):
  git push origin v2.x.y

The github hooks will automatically start the build process and
create a released tar-file.

If there is an error in the tag it is possible to delete it locally,
re-create it at a new commit and push it over the old one:
  git tag -d v2.x.y
  git tag -s v2.x.y
  git push origin v2.x.y

If for some reason the tag needs removing entirely, it can be deleted
locally, from the remote server, and from the mirror:
  git tag -d v2.x.y
  git push origin :refs/tags/v2.x.y
  ssh firehol.org
  sudo -i -u firehol
  git --git-dir mirrors/firehol.git tag -d v2.x.y
