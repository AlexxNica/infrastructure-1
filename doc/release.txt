                           Release Process
                           ***************

Pre-release
===========
Ensure everything is checked in that should be:
  git status

Perform a dry-run of the build:
  cd firehol
  ./packaging/git-build

Run any further tests.

Ensure all files are listed in EXTRA_DIST in Makefile.am files as needed:
  ./packaging/check-contents . firehol-development.tar.gz | less


Release
=======
To release a new version of FireHOL, commit a change with up to date
ChangeLog and NEWS (they will be checked before the tag is built).

Tag the commit with a signature:
  git tag -s v2.x.y -m "Release version 2.x.y"

Push the tag (origin is the default name of the remote repository):
  git push origin tag v2.x.y

The github hooks will automatically start the build process and
create a released tar-file.

If there is an error in the tag it is possible to move to a new commit,
delete the old tag locally, re-create it and push it over the old one:
  ....
  git tag -d v2.x.y
  git tag -s v2.x.y
  git push origin tag v2.x.y

If for some reason the tag needs removing entirely, it can be deleted
locally, from the remote server, and from the mirror:
  git tag -d v2.x.y
  git push origin :refs/tags/v2.x.y
  ssh firehol.org
  sudo -i -u firehol
  git --git-dir mirrors/firehol.git tag -d v2.x.y


Signing the results
====================
The outputs go to:
  http://firehol.org/download/unsigned/v2.x.y

Run the sign-version script, with no v on the version and with an
identifier for your GPG key e.g.:
  sign-version 2.x.y sanewall

This will check the signature in git, grab the bz2, gz and xz files
and compare the main firehol and fireqos scripts to ensure the contents
all match.

If everything is OK, detached signatures will be created for each file.


Finally
=======
Upload the signatures to the host and move the directory to release:
  scp *.asc firehol.org:.
  ssh firehol.org
  d=/home/web/firehol/download
  v=2.x.y
  sudo -u firehol cp firehol-$v.*.asc $d/unsigned/v$v/
  sudo -u firehol mv $d/unsigned/v$v/ $d/releases/
  sudo -u firehol rm $d/latest
  sudo -u firehol ln -s $d/releases/v$v $d/latest
