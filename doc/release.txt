                           Release Process
                           ***************

To release a new version of FireHOL, commit a change with up to date
ChangeLog and NEWS (they will be checked before the tag is built).

Tag the commit with a signature:
  git tag -s v2.x.y

Push the tag (origin is the default name of the remote repository):
  git push origin tag v2.x.y

The github hooks will automatically start the build process and
create a released tar-file.

If there is an error in the tag it is possible to move to a new commit,
delete the old tag locally, re-create it and push it over the old one:
  ....
  git tag -d v2.x.y
  git tag -s v2.x.y
  git push origin tag v2.x.y

If for some reason the tag needs removing entirely, it can be deleted
locally, from the remote server, and from the mirror:
  git tag -d v2.x.y
  git push origin :refs/tags/v2.x.y
  ssh firehol.org
  sudo -i -u firehol
  git --git-dir mirrors/firehol.git tag -d v2.x.y

TODO
====
The outputs go to:
  http://firehol.org/download/unsigned/....somewhere...

Some extra infrastructure is needed to allow the committer to verify
that the content of the built tar-files match what they tagged and if
so to gpg-sign the files and move them to a "signed" location and update
a "latest" link if appropriate.
