                           Common Release Process
                           **********************

For FireHOL below 3.0, see "release-firehol-v2.txt" or "release-firehol-v1.txt"

Pre-release
===========
Ensure the hooks are installed, they will take care of all the checking
and much of the work.


Release
=======
You need a gpg key setup to sign with.

Update configure.ac, ChangeLog and any .spec.in files.

  N.B. pre-release tags should be of the form vx.y.z-pre.nn or vx.y.z-rc.nn
  in order to comply with http://semver.org/ without limiting the number
  of such releases.

Use "git commit" in the normal way. The hooks will detect a release
and do the following:

* Test build
* Prepare a suitable message
* Ask you to sign a tag
* Update the configure.ac for continuing development and commit it

If you are satisfied with the results, push the repo and tag as
instructed. If not roll back as directed in packaging/README.md.

The github hooks will automatically start the build process and
create a released tar-file.


Signing the results
====================
The outputs go to e.g:
  http://firehol.org/download/unsigned/vx.y.z
ot:
  http://firehol.org/download/iprange/unsigned/vx.y.z

Run the sign[<product] script, with no v on the version and with an
identifier for your GPG key e.g.:
  ./bin/sign-firehol x.y.z firehol
or:
  ./bin/sign-iprange x.y.z firehol

This will check the signature in git, grab the bz2, gz and xz files
and compare the main scripts in sbin/ to ensure the contents all match.

If everything is OK, detached signatures will be created for each file.


Finally
=======
Upload the signatures to the host and move the directory to release:
  scp *.asc firehol.org:.

Login:
  ssh firehol.org

Choose suitable release directory:
  d=/home/web/firehol/download/
or:
  d=/home/web/firehol/download/iprange

Release the files:
  v=x.y.z
  sudo -u firehol cp *-$v.*.asc $d/unsigned/v$v/
  sudo -u firehol mv $d/unsigned/v$v/ $d/releases/

If this is to be made the latest stable release:
  sudo -u firehol rm $d/latest
  sudo -u firehol ln -s $d/releases/v$v $d/latest

Announce on the mailing lists and website

If it all goes wrong
====================

If for some reason a tag needs removing entirely, it can be deleted
locally, from the remote server, and from the mirror:
  git tag -d vz.y.z
  git push origin :refs/tags/vx.y.z
  ssh firehol.org
  sudo -i -u firehol
  git --git-dir mirrors/[product].git tag -d vx.y.z
