The website is built using nanoc version 3. There are newer versions
which are not compatible. At some point the site will be upgraded
to v4.

To install:
  http://nanoc.ws/install/

Essentially, this as root:
  aptitude install rubygems
  gem install nanoc --version 3.8.0

mkdir -p /home/web/firehol
mkdir -p /home/web/firehol/download
mkdir -p /home/web/firehol/static
mkdir -p /home/web/firehol/tmp
mkdir -p /home/web/firehol/webalizer

The sites must be manually installed in nginx the first time, e.g.:

cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
ln -s /home/web/firehol/master.conf 10-firehol-master
ln -s /home/web/firehol/master.conf 15-firehol-test

The master site must have a lower number than all the others so that it
is used by default.

The scripts which deploy the website need to be able to restart nginx,
so an entry such as the following should be added to /etc/sudoers:

firehol ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: /etc/init.d/nginx restart
firehol ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/nginx -t
