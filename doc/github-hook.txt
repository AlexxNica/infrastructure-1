                           GitHub Hooks
                           ************

Add the following to the nginx server configuration:

	location /github-hook.php {
		alias /home/firehol/web/github-hook.php;
		fastcgi_pass  unix:/var/run/php-fpm.sock;
		include       fastcgi_params;
	}

Under the github repository settings, add a webhook URL:
        http://firehol.org/github-hook.php

The PHP script parses the incoming JSON and creates build instructions
in web/requests which are acted on by a cron-job.
