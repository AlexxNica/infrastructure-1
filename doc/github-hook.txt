                           GitHub Hooks
                           ************

Server configuration
====================
Only repositories and branches that are listed will in `etc/build.conf`
be built automatically (since only branches that the scripts understand how
to build can be used).

Create files in `hook-credentials` called e.g.:

    firehol.github.secret

Where the form is `organisation`.`username`.secret.

The organisation is extracted from the URL
(https://github.org/organisation/repo).

The username is always `github` when triggered by a GitHub hook, it does
not relate to the user pushing or owner of the repository.


GitHub Configuration
====================
Under the github repository settings, add a webhook URL:

    https://firehol.org/github-hook.php

Set SSL verification on and choose the same secret as will be set in the
hook-credentials/*.github.secret files.

For each repository to be monitored:

* https://github.com/firehol/firehol/settings/hooks
* https://github.com/firehol/iprange/settings/hooks
* https://github.com/firehol/infrastructure/settings/hooks
* https://github.com/firehol/netdata/settings/hooks
* https://github.com/firehol/website/settings/hooks


Nginx Configuration
===================
Add the following to the nginx server configuration:

	location /github-hook.php {
		alias /home/firehol/web/github-hook.php;
		fastcgi_pass  unix:/var/run/php-fpm.sock;
		include       fastcgi_params;
	}

The PHP script parses the incoming JSON and creates build instructions
in web/requests which are acted on by a cron-job.

Handy for debugging:

  e.g. curl -X POST -d "fizz=buzz" http://requestb.in/1j5898a1
       firefox http://requestb.in/1j5898a1?inspect
