                           **********************

Each facility provided is given a brief description and a pointer to
set-up/maintenance documentation.

This repository should be exported as the home directory of a user,
firehol, who is a member of group firehol.

Create the user in the normal way, then as root:

  rm -rf firehol
  git clone https://github.com/philwhineray/firehol-infrastructure.git firehol
  chown -R firehol:firehol firehol

Mirroring
---------
Mirrors of other git repositories (in particular the official firehol
repository) are maintained. See /etc/firehol-mirrors.conf for a list.

These mirrors are used to perform local git operations by other facilities,
as well as providing a fallback.

See doc/mirrors.txt for setup information.
