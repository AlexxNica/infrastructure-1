                           FireHOL Infrastructure
                           **********************

This repository is devoted to maintaining scripts and information
related to releasing FireHOL and maintaining its servers.

Each facility provided is given a brief description and a pointer to
set-up/maintenance documentation.

Prerequisites
=============
This repository should be exported as the home directory of a user,
firehol, who is a member of group firehol.

Create the user in the normal way, then as root:
  cd /home
  rm -rf firehol
  git clone https://github.com/philwhineray/firehol-infrastructure.git firehol
  chown -R firehol:firehol firehol
  find firehol -type d -exec chmod g+s \{\} \;

To update the firehol user's copy of the project:
  sudo -u firehol -i
  git pull


Facilities
==========

Mirroring
---------
Mirrors of other git repositories (in particular the official firehol
repository) are maintained. See /etc/firehol-mirrors.conf for a list.

These mirrors are used to perform local git operations by other facilities,
as well as providing a fallback.

See doc/mirrors.txt for setup information.


Key Checking/Signing
--------------------
Any public keys imported will be used to validate signatures against
the git repositories.

See doc/gpg.txt for more information.


Build from tag
--------------
The script bin/firehol-tgz can be used to build a releasable but unsigned
set of files from a correctly signed tag:
  firehol-tgz logfile tag existing-output-dir

The output is the tar-file compressed with various schemes and checksums
for them as well as manuals, README and ChangeLog.


GitHub hooks
------------
Ensure that the web server can create requests to be processed:
  chmod 777 web/requests

See doc/github-hook.txt for more details.
